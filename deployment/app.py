         'Benign keratinocytic tumours are extremely common and mainly of cosmetic concern. They may occasionally prove painful',
         'Dermatofibroma is a common overgrowth of the fibrous tissue situated in the dermis (the deeper of the two main layers of the skin). It is benign (harmless) and ill not turn into a cancer. Whilst dermatofibromas are harmless, they can be similar in appearance to other concerning skin tumours. It is therefore important to see a health professional for a diagnosis',
         'Melanoma is a cancer that develops from melanocytes, the skin cells that produce melanin pigment, which gives skin its color.',
         'Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms or hamartomas composed of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells that constitutively colonize the epidermis.',
         'Vascular lesions are relatively common abnormalities of the skin and underlying tissues, more commonly known as birthmarks. There are three major categories of vascular lesions: Hemangiomas, Vascular Malformations, and Pyogenic Granulomas'
